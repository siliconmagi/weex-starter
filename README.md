 > NOTE: Currently the vue renderer is not ready, the web page isn't rendering by Vue components.

### Run The Android Project

First you should install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and Android SDK.

Assuming you have configured the Android development environment properly, just use Android Studio to open the project in the `android` folder, and run the app as other normal Android projects.

> NOTE: If don't find the android project, open the file `android/build.graddle`. Android Studio will then create the android project.

### Run The iOS Project

First you should [setup the iOS develop environment](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppStoreDistributionTutorial/Setup/Setup.html) and install the [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

Enter the `ios` path, use CocoaPods to install dependencies:

```
pod install
```

Open the project in the `ios` folder by Xcode. 

 > NOTE: If needed, drag the `Pods.xcodeproj` file to Xcode and add its libs to the project.

Run the app on the simulator.

 > NOTE: If you want to run the app on real device, you also need to setup your own signing configuration.
